    and let the program do its magic! \n \nFor matches navigate to the matches tab and enter in the required fields
        \n \nAt the end of your scouting press "Get Best (Pit/Match) Team" and watch

        app is still under development, you may not be able to reach every text field so we
    recommend that you add as many as you can see then retract your keyboard so that you can see the other
        fields and enter the required values for them. \n \n*Algorithm gets best team based on MMR system. May not provide the best in
